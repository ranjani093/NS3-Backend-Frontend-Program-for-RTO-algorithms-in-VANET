### VANET Simulation with CC-RTO and Hybrid-RTO Algorithms

#### Overview
This repository is dedicated to the implementation and simulation of two advanced Rate-based Transmission Control Protocol (RTO) algorithms, namely CC-RTO and Hybrid-RTO, within the Network Simulator 3 (NS3) framework. These algorithms are tailored for VANET (Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network) environments and leverage mobility scenarios generated by the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) tool. The repository is structured to facilitate easy integration and testing of these algorithms, providing both backend and frontend modifications required for comprehensive simulations.

#### Repository Structure

1. **CC-RTO Implementation**
   - The `CC-RTO` folder contains the modified source files implementing the CC-RTO algorithm. This algorithm is based on the Jacobson algorithm and provides an accurate retransmission timeout estimator for content-centric networking.
   - Key Files:
     - `rtt-estimator.cc`: This file includes the core modifications for the CC-RTO algorithm, enhancing the retransmission timeout estimation process.
     - `rtt-estimator.h`: The header file accompanying `rtt-estimator.cc`, outlining the necessary function declarations and modifications.
   - The implementation is based on the paper: Nikzad, M., Jamshidi, K., Bohlooli, A., & Faqiry, F. M. (2022). An accurate retransmission timeout estimator for content-centric networking based on the Jacobson algorithm. Digital Communications and Networks, 8(6), 1085-1093.

2. **Hybrid-RTO Implementation**
   - The `Hybrid-RTO` folder encompasses the files required for the Hybrid-RTO algorithm, which optimizes the retransmission timeout interval for bundle protocols.
   - Key Files:
     - `rtt-estimator.cc`: Contains the algorithmic modifications specific to Hybrid-RTO.
     - `rtt-estimator.h`: Header file supporting the `rtt-estimator.cc` with necessary declarations.
     - `tcp-socket-base.cc`: Includes additional modifications needed for integrating Hybrid-RTO with the TCP socket base.
     - `tcp-socket-base.h`: Header file providing declarations for changes in `tcp-socket-base.cc`.
   - This implementation follows the research detailed in the paper: Yang, G., Wang, R., Sabbagh, A., Zhao, K., & Zhang, X. (2018). Modeling optimal retransmission timeout interval for bundle protocol. IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 54(5), 2493-2508.

3. **Frontend Setup for VANET Simulations**
   - The `Frontend` folder is designed to house the frontend `.cc` files essential for running the simulations in the NS3 environment, alongside the various mobility files generated by SUMO.
   - Contents:
     - The primary `.cc` file which sets up the VANET simulation, integrating the RTO algorithms and handling the overall simulation flow.
     - Mobility files: These are generated using SUMO and define the vehicle-to-vehicle communication scenarios, including respective movement patterns and dynamics crucial for realistic VANET simulations.

#### How to Use
To utilize the provided implementations and run the simulations:

1. **Backend Modifications**:
   - Replace the existing backend files in the NS3 environment with those provided in the respective `CC-RTO` or `Hybrid-RTO` folders. This involves updating the `rtt-estimator.cc`, `rtt-estimator.h`, and for Hybrid-RTO, the `tcp-socket-base.cc` and `tcp-socket-base.h` files as well.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Place the provided frontend `.cc` file from the `Frontend` folder into the `NS3/scratch` directory. This file orchestrates the simulation setup, integrating the RTO algorithms and defining the simulation parameters.
   - Ensure that the mobility files generated by SUMO are correctly referenced and included in the simulation setup.

3. **Running Simulations**:
   - With the files in place, execute the simulations within NS3. The setup will enable you to observe and compare the performance and behavior of both CC-RTO and Hybrid-RTO algorithms under various VANET scenarios.

#### Notes and References
- Compatibility: Ensure that your NS3 environment is correctly set up and compatible with the provided files and modifications.
- Dependencies: Verify all dependencies and prerequisites for running NS3 simulations are fulfilled.
- Detailed insights into the algorithms can be found in the respective research papers provided.

By following these instructions, users can effectively simulate and analyze the performance of CC-RTO and Hybrid-RTO algorithms in a VANET environment, leveraging the comprehensive mobility scenarios provided.
